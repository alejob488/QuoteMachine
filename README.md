# QuoteMachine
Quote Machine developed by me as Free Code Camp #1 Intermediate Front End Development Projects

<ol>
  <li>Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/ONjoLe/</li>
  <li>Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.</li>
  <li>Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.</li>
  <li>User Story: I can click a button to show me a new random quote.</li>
  <li>User Story: I can press a button to tweet out a quote.</li>
  <li>Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.</li>
  <li>When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.</li>
  <li>You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.</li>
